There is a commented test, that will iterate over all games possibilities.
It was disabled because it was taking so much time to complete.

```js
	it('All possibles games', function () {		
		console.log('All possible games is disabled, because, that will take too long time.');
		return; // <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
